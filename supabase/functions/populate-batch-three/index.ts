    title: "Mobile Touch Gesture Patterns",
    content: "Mobile gesture interactions enhance user experience through intuitive touch controls. Primary gestures: tap (activation), swipe (navigation), pinch/zoom (scaling), long press (context menus), pull-to-refresh (content updates). Advanced gestures: force touch, edge swipes, multi-finger gestures. Design considerations: touch target size (44px minimum), gesture feedback, conflict resolution. Implementation requires touch event handling, gesture recognition, and haptic feedback integration.",

Key elements: heading hierarchy (H1-H6), landmark roles, alt text for images, form labels, skip links. Implementation: aria-live regions for dynamic content, focus management, keyboard navigation support. Testing with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver essential. Proper implementation increases accessibility compliance by 85% and improves SEO rankings.",

Common breakpoints: 320px (small mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1440px (large desktop). CSS Grid and Flexbox enable flexible layouts. Mobile-first approach improves performance by 40%.

Duration guidelines: micro-interactions (100-300ms), transitions (300-500ms), complex animations (500-1000ms). Principles: follow-through, overlapping action, staging. CSS transforms perform better than property animations. Respect reduced motion preferences for accessibility.",
