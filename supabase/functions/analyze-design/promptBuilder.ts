ANALYSIS HIERARCHY AND LOGIC:
1. PRIMARY FOCUS: If the user has provided a main comment or specific request, this is your primary directive
2. ANNOTATION SUPPORT: If user has highlighted specific areas, treat these as supporting evidence for the main comment
3. COMPREHENSIVE BASELINE: Always perform a complete analysis of all images individually and comparatively
4. INTELLIGENT EXPANSION: If user input is minimal, perform thorough analysis of what's good and what needs improvement

- Identify strengths and weaknesses in each design independently
- Note specific elements that work well or need improvement

STEP 2 - COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS:
- Compare design approaches across all ${imageCount} images
- Identify inconsistencies in branding, layout, navigation, and user experience
- Determine which design patterns are most effective and why
- Highlight cross-design opportunities for improvement

STEP 3 - STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Provide actionable recommendations that address both individual image issues and cross-design consistency
- Prioritize improvements based on user experience impact and business value
- Consider user journey implications when moving between these designs
