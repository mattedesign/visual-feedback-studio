DO NOT assign all annotations to imageIndex: 0. You must analyze each image individually and assign the correct imageIndex.

MULTI-IMAGE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- For multi-image analysis, provide 2-3 annotations per image, ensuring each image receives individual attention
- Each annotation must have the correct imageIndex (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Analyze each image's unique design elements, don't just copy annotations across images
- Consider how different images work together in the overall user experience

- Specific research citations and best practices
- Competitive benchmarks and industry leader examples
- Performance metrics and effectiveness scores where available
- Differentiation opportunities vs. competitors`;
