    title: "Design Tokens and Systematic Scaling",
    content: "Design tokens are the atomic values of a design system - colors, typography, spacing, and timing. They enable consistent scaling across platforms and themes. JSON-based tokens can be consumed by design tools and code. Semantic naming (primary-500 vs blue-500) provides flexibility for theme changes. Token hierarchies prevent inconsistencies and speed up design decisions. Automated token updates across codebases reduce maintenance overhead by 70%.",
