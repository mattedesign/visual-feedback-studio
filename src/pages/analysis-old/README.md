# Archived Analysis Pages

This directory contains the original analysis system pages that were archived during the transition to Figmant v128.1 Goblin Edition.

**Archive Date:** January 2025
**Reason:** Preparing namespace for new goblin-based analysis system

## What's Archived Here
- Analysis.tsx - Main analysis interface
- AnalysisResults.tsx - Results display page
- AnalyzeResults.tsx - Results page variant

## Status
- ❌ **ARCHIVED** - These pages are preserved but not actively used
- ✅ **REFERENCE ONLY** - Available for reference during goblin development
- 🔄 **REPLACEABLE** - New goblin system uses `/goblin` routes

## Migration Notes
- New goblin pages will be under `src/pages/goblin/`
- Routes will be `/goblin/*` instead of `/analysis/*`
